This contains the pinvoke methods for the DSM entry.
This is the lowest API level of the lib and should not
be used directly unless you know what you're doing. 

A higher level abstraction such as the ones in the
`Triplets` namespace or the `TwainAppSession` object
would be easier to use.

The individual classes are generated by the 
`DSMGenerator.tt` file.
